# 🎯 Hackathon Problem Analysis

## **What Problem Are We Solving?**

You're building an **AI-powered data exploration platform** that lets **non-technical users** ask questions about their data in plain English and get instant visualizations—without writing SQL, Python, or any code.

**Think of it as:** "ChatGPT for your business data" - you upload data sources, ask questions naturally, and get charts/reports automatically.

---

## **Core User Journey**

1. **User connects data** (upload CSV/Excel, or connect to a database)
2. **System understands the data** (reads columns, infers relationships)
3. **User asks natural language questions** like "Show me sales by month"
4. **AI converts question → query → visualization**
5. **User refines interactively** ("Now only for 2024", "Show as pie chart")

## **DATASIGHTS PROMPT** (Copy Below)

```
I'm building an AI-powered ad-hoc reporting platform for a hackathon. Create a React.js application with these requirements:

## CORE FEATURES TO BUILD:

### 1. DATA SOURCE CONNECTION
- File upload interface supporting:
  - CSV files
  - Excel files (.xlsx)
- Display uploaded file info (name, size, row count)
- Parse and preview first 10 rows in a table

### 2. SCHEMA UNDERSTANDING
- Automatically detect:
  - Column names and data types (string, number, date)
  - Sample values for each column
- Display schema in a clean, readable format
- Show data statistics (min, max, avg for numbers; unique count for strings)

### 3. NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY INTERFACE
- Chat-style interface where users can type questions like:
  - "Show total sales by month"
  - "Top 5 products by revenue"
  - "Compare Q1 vs Q2 performance"
- Use the Anthropic Claude API to:
  - Parse natural language questions
  - Determine which columns are needed
  - Generate appropriate aggregations (sum, count, average, etc.)
  - Decide best visualization type

### 4. DYNAMIC VISUALIZATION
- Generate charts automatically using Recharts library:
  - Bar charts (for comparisons)
  - Line charts (for trends over time)
  - Pie charts (for proportions)
  - Data tables (for detailed views)
- Allow users to switch between chart types
- Interactive filters and legends

### 5. CONVERSATIONAL FOLLOW-UPS
- Maintain conversation context so users can ask:
  - "Now break it down by region"
  - "Only show last 6 months"
  - "Change to a pie chart"
- Display conversation history

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

**Frontend Stack:**
- React.js with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for visualizations
- PapaParse for CSV parsing
- SheetJS (xlsx) for Excel parsing

**AI Integration:**
- Use Anthropic Claude API (accessed via fetch to https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages)
- System prompt should instruct Claude to:
  - Analyze the data schema
  - Parse user questions
  - Return structured JSON with: {columns_needed, aggregation_type, filter_conditions, chart_type, explanation}
  - Generate JavaScript code to process the data

**Data Processing:**
- All processing happens in browser (no backend needed for MVP)
- Use JavaScript array methods (filter, map, reduce) to:
  - Filter rows based on conditions
  - Group by columns
  - Calculate aggregations
  - Format data for charts

## FILE STRUCTURE:
```
src/
├── App.jsx (main application)
├── components/
│   ├── FileUploader.jsx
│   ├── DataPreview.jsx
│   ├── ChatInterface.jsx
│   ├── ChartRenderer.jsx
│   └── SchemaViewer.jsx
└── utils/
    ├── dataParser.js
    ├── queryProcessor.js
    └── claudeAPI.js
```

## KEY FUNCTIONALITY FLOW:

1. **Upload Phase:**
   - User uploads CSV/Excel
   - Parse file and store data in state
   - Auto-detect schema and show preview

2. **Query Phase:**
   - User types natural language question
   - Send to Claude API with data schema
   - Claude returns structured query plan

3. **Processing Phase:**
   - Execute query plan on dataset
   - Transform data into chart-ready format

4. **Visualization Phase:**
   - Render appropriate chart type
   - Show explanation of what was calculated
   - Enable chart type switching and filters

5. **Refinement Phase:**
   - User asks follow-up question
   - Maintain context from previous query
   - Re-process and update visualization

## IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

- Start with CSV support only (Excel is bonus)
- Focus on common aggregations: SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN
- Handle date parsing for time-based queries
- Show loading states during API calls
- Display error messages clearly
- Make the UI clean and professional

## SAMPLE INTERACTION:

User uploads "sales_data.csv" with columns: [date, product, region, revenue, quantity]

User asks: "Show total revenue by month"
→ Claude analyzes schema
→ Returns: {group_by: "date (by month)", aggregate: "sum(revenue)", chart: "bar"}
→ App processes data
→ Displays bar chart with months on X-axis, total revenue on Y-axis

User asks: "Now only for the East region"
→ Claude understands context
→ Returns: {filter: "region = East", maintain_previous_grouping: true}
→ App re-processes with filter
→ Updates chart

Please build this step-by-step, starting with file upload and data preview, then adding the AI query interface, then visualizations.
```

# 📖 What Each Component Does

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **FileUploader** | Drag-drop zone to upload CSV/Excel files |
| **DataPreview** | Shows first 10 rows in a table |
| **SchemaViewer** | Displays column names, types, stats |
| **ChatInterface** | Text input + conversation history |
| **ChartRenderer** | Renders Bar/Line/Pie charts based on data |
| **claudeAPI.js** | Handles API calls to Claude |
| **queryProcessor.js** | Executes data transformations (filter/group/aggregate) |

# 🎓 What Makes This Solution Stand Out

✅ **No-code data exploration** - anyone can use it  
✅ **Multi-source support** - CSV + Excel  
✅ **Conversational** - follow-up questions maintain context  
✅ **Auto-visualization** - AI picks the best chart type  
✅ **Fully client-side** - no backend needed for MVP

# 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Copy the Replit prompt above** into Claude in your Replit project
2. Claude will build the React app component-by-component
3. Test with sample CSV files (sales data works great)
4. Add bonus features if time permits (Excel support, PDF export, etc.)

Would you like me to also create **sample CSV data** you can use for testing, or help you design the **Claude API prompt** that will power the natural language understanding?
